# Rules of /r/homelab

### Reporting Posts 
Please report any posts that do not follow the below rules. The mods will follow up on reports quite fast so please do use this tool!

### 1. Don't be an asshole
This is a great community with many awesome people, don't ruin that. Any negativity or unnecessary comments will be dealt with and possible bans will be handed out. The mod team does take note of abusive behaviour.

If you do not agree with the content of a post, this is no excuse to be an asshole, if you feel the content is not suitable for the community then please report it to the mods and they will review the report.


### [2. Post Details](https://old.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/rules/postdetails)
Posts about your homelab must be accompanied by a *top level comment* or description as part of your post with details about the setup.

This cannot simply be a list of the hardware but should include at least two of the below to make this an interesting post for the community: 

* What have you got in the post?
* What are you using it for?
* How are you planning to configure?
* **Why are you doing this?**


### 3. No memes
No memes please, this is a serious sub. Images of your home setup are encouraged **with accompanying writeup.** Try not to make it a potato photo though. Please. 


### 4. Posts must be homelab related
Discussion about your homelab, homelabing, questions you may have, discussion about applying your skill from the homelab to the workplace are all acceptable reasons to post. Unrelated posts will be removed.

If your question is about hardware not specifically related to homelabs (Including peripherals and desktop KVMs) such as general r/techsupport, r/homenetworking, r/homeautomation, r/CCTV, r/homesecurity or software such as r/Plex, r/Minecraft or more broadly r/selfhosted then please visit a more suitable sub, this will mean you get better support and keeps the content of this sub relevant.

**Do not post asking for advice on your business, your job, bypassing your school's network etc. This subreddit is not your own personal help desk.**


### 5. Low Effort Posts
Please no shitposting, blogspam and general low effort posts.  This includes posts which really do not serve any purpose in /r/homelab, or lower the quality of content. 

This includes things such as:

* Request for help with no evidence of prior research (This isn't Google)
* Screenshots of your internet connection, storage, RAM
* Pictures of hardware on their own without anything interesting happening. ("Just got an R710!") - We've all seen what servers look like
* Picture(s) of boxes
* "LabPorn" which is just a home network
* "I want to run this" what hardware do I need - do your own research
* 'How did I do posts'
* Links and cross posts without an accompanying comment/description
* Daily/weekly lab updates


### 6. Piracy/Keys

Keep piracy discussion off of this subreddit, everything here should be done legally and through the right means. Mentions of and recommendations of piracy to other users will be removed and you will be banned if trying to endorse/sell keys, this includes 'key swaps' and giveaways of keys. This also includes all mention of grey market keys, the use of software for generally accepted illegal means, or requesting firmware files that are not publicly available.

If you happen to be a legally authorized distributor of software/keys and would like to provide said product to /r/homelab users either promotionally or on an ongoing basis - please message the mods, we'd love to hear from you.


### 7. No Referral Links/Advertising
We do not allow links/posts that include any sort of referral link or promotion of your own products or services.

Linking to specific posts on your blog or a tutorial on your YouTube channel are allowed providing the content is home lab related, suitable flair is applied and rule 5 is followed.

If you think you have an exception please ask the mods first. We also do not allow advertising of your products, if you would like to post something like this please check with the mod team first.


### 8. Sales and Offers
Please post sales, wants, offers, deals and price checks to /r/homelabsales.

The community has repeatedly told us they do not want to see any form of sales, regardless of who is selling it, on this subreddit. If you would like an exception, ask first. But the answer will probably be "no" as it is a very rare that this sort of content is legitimately ok.

As deals are commonly**regionally specific** they would be of greater benefit to people on the homelabsales forum where they can get sorted and searched for.


### 9. No Pandering

Posts of "Humble" labs or age related posts are seen as an attempt to gain extra karma, please keep post titles relevant, good content should not require pandering titles. This also includes adding your age to your post title, this is considered pandering, amongst others. 


### 10. Giveaways

Giveaways must be vetted by the mod team prior to being posted. This is as a safety measure of our community, along with the credibility of the community and its members.
